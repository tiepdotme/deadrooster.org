    <p>One month ago, Dead Rooster was in Barcelona for the Primavera Festival. This very friday, in the middle afternoon, Joe Gantdelaine and I were sitting in the Parc Central del Poblenou, a satellite stage of the festival. There, we have grass rather than concrete but unexplicably, the vast majority of the festival audience snubs it. A San Miguel cup in hand, comfortably seated in plastic garden chairs, in the shade of the surrounding trees, we watched the concert of the Fresh &amp; Onlys, the authors of the recent <em>Play It Strange</em>. The concert convinced us to get it.</p>
<p>The record starts with a charming lightness song, <em>Summer Of Love</em>. Clean guitars and heavy reverb for the lead singing voice makes it an easy and seducing introduction, in an atmosphere caribbeanized by organs, xylophones and bongas. The second track is a different gear: high-pitched vocals, the bass leads the way while the guitar keeps playing this simple but terrific riff that concludes the best song of the album, <em>Waterfall</em>, <a href="706">that you might have already seen here</a>.</p>

<p>If Lee Mavers was twenty years younger, was taking anti-depressants and Frosties for breakfast, was born in San Fransico and spent more time at the beach, The La’s would be called The Fresh &amp; Onlys. Of course, the comparison is completely stupid, but let’s face it: same taste for the coolest possible folk (<em>Until The End Of Time</em>, <em>Red Light, Green Light</em>), same mix of perfect pop songs (<em>Waterfall</em> for sure, but <em>Be My Hooker</em> and <em>Plague Of Frogs</em> as well) and epic titles (<em>Tropical Island Suite</em>).</p>

<p>It may sound too wise to be a great record, but Fresh &amp; Onlys can also be weird and crazy as in <em>Who Needs A Man</em>, which does make <em>Play It Strange</em> the best record we’ve listened to for a while. And, unlike The La’s, The Fresh &amp; Onlys release a lot of stuff : <em>Play It Strange</em> is already the third album of the band. We should try to get <em>The Fresh &amp; Onlys</em> and <em>Grey-Eyed Girls</em>, the two previous albums, as fast as we can.</p>
<p>Let me conclude by this nice anecdote about the fact that <a href="849">people should buy vinyle records again</a>. Plus it proves the band is really cool. A few minutes after the concert ended, i went close to the stage to ask the band if they could sell me their record. The guitarist nodded and gave me the 12” record saying: “we sell these 20 euros at the festival but right now, just name your price and it will be fine”. The deal was set for 12 euros, MP3-download-coupon and hand-shake included.</p>
